We built our data structure in this way, with the goal of having an easy adapting back end, a back end which
can deal and work with different front Ends.
 
Each kind of front end will work with the 'BackDataManger' as a mediator. He knows to start our data structure
by getting inputs by a few different ways, he questions the data structure, produces different insights & outputs
it to the front end in a simplified way.
